# Global-Pharmaceutical-Spending-Analysis
This project explores the relationship between national economic indicators and pharmaceutical drug spending across countries. Designed as a self-initiated data science learning exercise, it demonstrates a full data analysis workflowâ€”from cleaning and exploration to insight generation.

The analysis aims to uncover how GDP and healthcare investment correlate with pharmaceutical expenditure and identify emerging market opportunities. These insights simulate how a pharmaceutical company might use data to drive strategic decisions in marketing, sales, and supply chain.
